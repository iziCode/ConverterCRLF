I've been trying to learn Go on my own, but I've been stumped on trying read from and write to ordinary files.

I can get as far as inFile, _ := os.Open(INFILE, 0, 0), but actually getting the content of the file doesn't make sense, because the read function takes a []byte as a parameter.

func (file *File) Read(b []byte) (n int, err Error)
file go
share
